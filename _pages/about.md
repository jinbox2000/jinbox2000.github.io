I am an Associate Research Scholar in High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI) of Princeton University. Broadly speaking, I am interested in earth system modeling (ESM) development and application, especially in stratospheric chemistry/dynamic coupling and its impact on ozone, representation of orographic drag parameterization in ESM, coupling of the land-surface model with the ESM to assess its impact on the atmosphere, detection and attribution of human impact on high profile extreme events. Currently, my study focuses on assessing impact of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) on process like stratospheric ozone.
