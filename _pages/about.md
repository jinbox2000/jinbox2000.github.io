I am an Associate Research Scholar at the High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI) of Princeton University, where I explore how human and natural processes that shape our climate. My work focuses on advancing Earth System Models (ESMs) to better understand stratospheric chemistry–dynamics interactions, including their effects on ozone, and to improve representations of sub-grid orographic drag and land-surface–atmosphere coupling. By combining model development with observational analysis, I aim to detect and attribute human influences on extreme climate events, providing insights that can guide mitigation and adaptation strategies. 
I'm a core model developer of the Department of Energy (DOE)-Exascale Energy Earth System Model (E3SM), and the subgrid orographic drag schemes I developed are now the default schemes in E3SM.
